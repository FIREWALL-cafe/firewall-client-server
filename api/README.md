# Firewall-Cafe API

Firewall-Cafe API is the interface between the app and the data stored in the database.

 - *server.js* is the script to run in order to interface with the firewall-cafe database and contains the routes for the API itself.
- *queries.js* links the database to the API and contains the specific functions the routes call in *server.js*.


## Installing and Running the API

Here's some nice placeholder text.

 1. Pull from the repository.
 2. Run `npm install`
 3. Run `node app.js` - (or run the app using any node process manager).
 4. The app should now be running and accessible on *port 11458*!
